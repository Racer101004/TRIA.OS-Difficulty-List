-- GENERAL GUIDELINES
1. The entry for new submissions must be a recognized map of TRIA.
2. Maps must not be a challenge or buff to an already existing map.
3. No joke maps.
4. The admins have the right to reject your submissions based on varying factors.
5. If a map is currently broken and is seeking fixes, please label the map as (BROKEN) before the Map Name, also **bold** formatted.
5. Should you be unsure of a map worthiness of being added, reach out to us in the official Discord.

-- FORMAT GUIDELINES
1. If there are multiple creators, please list your team name instead.
2. If your map does not have a team name, list the main creator/host instead.
3. If the map has a custom ID (Generally found in featured maps), please list in the ID as `numerical ID/custom ID`
4. The YouTube video has to be map completion video. Nothing else.
